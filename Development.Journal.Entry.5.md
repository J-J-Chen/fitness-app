I looked at some videos from UDACITY and attempted to add content to our app. Jai and I are going to meet next weekend as we did not meet over the weekend. We are looking towards having a complete menu soon that will allow for button configurations and other abilites such as a sliding selection menu for going to different menus for FitAddiction. We didn't make a lot of progress overall this week, but hopefully we can get a lot done this upcoming school week. Jai and I will probably be doing a lot of work over Spring Break as that would allow for us to devote many hours at one time. Both of our schedules are quite full, and that is why progress is difficult to achieve. Hopefully we can get a working app that has some menus and a fitness plan organizer by the due date for the second deliverable. I think that would be a good goal for now.
