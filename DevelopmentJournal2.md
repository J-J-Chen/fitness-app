Our app development is going smoothly. We mapped out all the things we wanted to do as we met last week for 3 hours to sort this out. We outlined all how the GUI wanted to look like. 
We drew up the plans on my laptop and agreed on the basic layout for each feature for our app and how we are going to implement each part in our app. We decided that we are going to have
a title bar on the top with the name of the user or the name of the feature the user is in. We would also have an "hamburger" to the top left which would give you options switch between
different features like our Journal, Calorie Keeper etc. At the bottom of that options tab would be a settings button to control those items in our app too. With the features we decided that
each feature would have different amount of pages that the user could swipe left and right through. We also talked about implementing some material design elements throughout the app to 
make the user experience feel nice. We got to know that we could use the Google Fit API to implement in our app to store a lot of the data. We decided on different phases on our apps. We would layout GUI in our app for real now making for our first deliverable hopefully. Then the data handling and storing we would handle last as that is the hardest part to this app. We have started to get familiar with Android Studio, learning more on how to make certain elements in the app because that is crucial to both of us working efficiently on it. We are again meeting tomorrow to code and make the GUI for the program.
