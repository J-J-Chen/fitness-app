This time making the GUI wasn't that hard. There was a learning curve tho. I used a lot of the android turtorials I have to make this new GUI. I implemented the new notes app to the app. We now have a notes menu so that we can add whatever we want that is a layout. I also added a picutre of the human body with all the muscles. When you click on various parts of the muscle it will take you to a list of excersices you could do with it. I also implemented searching for a workout or food that will give you the calories you burned or the calorie intake you will have. I added a lot of code to implement the notes taking part of it. A lot of code is going to go to that as I added some previous classes that weren't there. Again completeting the GUI if seen simiple and minimal progress was actually quite the work. Figuring out the linaer layouts, card views, relative layouts and how they all string together was actually quite the challenge. It took me like 30 minutes to figure out that you have to change the position in linear layout to "vertical" for all the things to be ordered that way or else I was banging my head on the desk not knowing how to make the button on top of the card view. So yea it seems minimal yet hard and that is our deliverable! whoop whoop! I'm so happy I finished it on Saturday and not Sunday at 11:58 pm.
