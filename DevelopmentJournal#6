This week again was fairly uneventful. I had a fairly busy weekend and so did Joe so we weren't able to make much progress on it. We are planning on meeting at Spring Break which we both have very open for and we are hoping to make a lot of progress throughout that break. We are planning that by the end of that break we will have all of our layouts done and our implementation will be started. If we don't we are basically the most screwed group ever because we have to have our finised UI in exactly 18 days which seems like a lot of days but just knowing us that is basically nothing. So hopefully I also make progress throughout the week it will help us and we need to manage our time more effectively.
