This week was kind of slow so I don't have much to talk about. I also did not get a day to work on the project in class as I was gone two days so that has kind of factored in. The only progress we made on this was what Joe told me he did. Joe looked at different menu options we could intergate into our app. The menu is a essential part in our app so making that work by hopefully next week sometime is a key thing so that our next deliverable isn't just rushed in a day. Our app is working fine so far but we need to intergate the different parts that are the hard part. Like the menu button has to actually slide out the menu not just do nothing. Intergating all the different layouts we need to have and everything is also going to be challenging as I can only do so much with the video tutorials and such. So right now we still need to work on it more and this week wasn't good progress at all but hopefully we can get more done in the future.
