#Development Journal Entry #9
##April 10, 2016
This week was fairly productive. I am in charge of implementing buttons onto the muscle diagram for the human body. Jai has already inserted the image into the app. I simply have to find a way to route the different partitions of the image to a menu interface. Jai has been working away on the notes function of the app which will allow for the user to make lists for workouts, dietary plans, and other related things. Our app has developed quite well as we have achieved many of the features we set out for. Jai is currently studying HTTP requests which will allow for him to connect to the server of MyFitnessPal. This will aid our app greatly as it will allow for searches for food or workout information. Our app is going quite well, and I believe we will meet the deadline. As we finish off our projects for the class, I hope that we can put more effort into developing our app.
