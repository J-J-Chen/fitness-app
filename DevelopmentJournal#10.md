So much progress has been made on the app. Hahahah I hope you didn't fall for that because we are where we stand last week. It has been really hard to make any progress on this because of all the AP Testing both Joe and I have to prep for. Joe has 5 AP Tests and I have 4 AP Tests so we are right now dug deep in books trying to study for them in two weeks. So that's why much progress hasn't been made on the development journals. Joe has been making some progress on his side as he has modified the body composition picture to remove all the labels on it so that we can put our own unqiue labels on it and make them clickable. I know Joe will try to figure out how to do that and good luck to him. On my side I have to do a lot of coding in terms of implementing the notes which won't be hard as I have a tutorial but everything else will be a frantic google search spend forever to know what 1% of it means and somehow make it work in the program. So that is where we stand and ya whoop!
