So after deleting this entry after I had it like 3/4 of the way done, I'm writing this kind of pissed off because GAH! Anyway, I started making the app this week (more like today because Procastination for the win! (not really it really is terrible)) and by god there are SO MANY MOVING PARTS. I did a lot of stuff to make the "basic" yet "not finished" GUI of the app. I'm using an Udemy course that I bought last year so I've been following along with that. In the course you make a "Notes App" and yea our app isn't a notes app but one of the functionality of it is making a note of the excercises you are going to do so that's why I started implementing all this stuff. I did so much that I really can't explain EVERY SINGLE thing but I'll give you a few basic ideas. 

#### First thing I did
So the first thing I did after I loaded up the project and selected blank activity was yell "Oh my god there is so much stuff, I'm so screwed". True story. Just kidding I didn't but I did think it. Anyway, the actual first thing I did was set up all the files I needed to and change the xml files I needed to for the app to work properly in the future. So I modified the colors.xml file, which added all the colors we are going to use for the app. That is subject to change as we build the app as some of the colors are from the resource files the course gives me and I havne't changed all of them as I don't need them yet. The main one I changed was the primary back ground color which is going to be like a "Kind of Black leaning towards Grey" and also put in a "Spotify Green" color to it. I changed the styles.xml and strings.xml to suit the app too. One of th emian things I also changed was the "grade" for the app as I had to change it to compile all the things I will implement in the future. Like different views and services I need. I added a lot of drawable folders plus I added a banner I made myself that says "FitAddiction" and will be displayed (and is displayed) in the drawer layout of our app. Also added the images the course used like a "loading" thing picture and Google Drive picture etc. 

####Second Thing I did
So now I started actually coding java! Finally after like a month! What a stud you are Jai! (Says no one ever) So I made a lot of classes. I first made the NavigationDraweritem, NavigationDrawerFragment and NavigationDrawerAdpater classes which by itself add for the items in the navigation drawer, tell you the iconID and Title, tells us the state of the navigation drawer like open closed and what to do if like it is in landscape mode or whatever. There is also a bunch of getters to convert views and stuff. I don't want to again go into too much detail because I don't want to write an essay

####Third Thing I did
I created a new layout, and this was the main drawer layout. So in this I added the banner I made. Changed the color to match our app and like added the list view to list all the items. It isn't done yet and it will be but not right now. By the way the layout file is called "fragment_navigation_drawer" so look at that to see what I've done.

####Fourth Thing I did
Created more classes like AppConstant, which are the constants to keep throughout the app. These constants include like literally all the variables I need and they all are static and final. I created the main Base Activity file. Now this is the largest coding file and is going to be hard to explain as a lot of things expalined in the video I watched I also didn't fully research but here it is. It basically sets up the functionality for the app. So what happens when you load it up. What happens when you click on certain things or pictures in the drawer and stuff. It changes your imageView, make different things so yea. A part of it is commented out because I haven't implemented the class described in the switch statement as that is for a later day but I will soon enough and when I do it will be uncommented and work fully!

####Last Thing I did
I created another activity called "activity_all_layout" which just shows the main activity for the notes part of the app. Here lives the "basic" form of the GUI for the ntoes app. It as you can see isn't done but it shows what I implemented. Three Image Views, A List view to list all the notes, A toolbar on the top. Some very basic stuff to expand upon. 

####Conclusion
My conclusion is making an app can be a *insert appropiate cuss word here dealing with a dog* I have been using my course as the guideline and I am not litearlly copying what he is telling me to do. I have to understand all the code he throws at me so that when it comes to make it for our own app I can change what is necassary and make it work. Right now I've kind of made the outer structure of the app and have to fill it in with the key components. It is a lot and I'll be working on it more proactively now, I can assure you because if I don't when the next deliverable comes around I will be utterly screwed. Anyway hope you enjoyed reading this mini essay I spent many minutes writing is fastly. Yes great English I know.
