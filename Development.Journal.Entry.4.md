We have made progress on the app. Jai used a coding academy to learn more about Android Studio. He made the color scheme and added basic images. The color scheme uses a lighter green, grey, and black all similar to the color scheme used by Spotify. I began using the coding academy program and aim to learn more about the program. Before the next deliverable, I hope to learn sufficient skills in order to aid in routing the images to other pages. This will require Java, and the coding academy should help with that. Jai added a banner to the app which portrays our app name "Fit Addiction". We also added a notes feature that allows for information regarding the many workouts that the user will be doing. A lot of work was done in the drawable folder as images were inserted for things such as Google Drive and Dropbox. All in all, after many hours of work, a outer structure for the Spotify-themed app was created.
