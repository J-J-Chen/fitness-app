#Development Journal Entry #8
##April 3, 2016
Jai finished the GUI of the app. We have a list making function to our app which would allow for people to make workout plans, meal plans, ect. Also, we now have a function that implements a search ability in regards to finding the number of calories in a food item as we had hoped to do as detailed from our proposal. Our app made the cut for our deliverable goal which is good. Know we are looking ahead and hope to develop more functionality to the app. Perhaps we can develop a recommendation functionality or even Spanish capabilities. I believe Spanish is definitely achievable, so that may be our goal to start off the third partition of the 20% project.  Our final project may contain many of the functions that we set out to have initially. Perhaps this project can be finished in time for the final due date.
