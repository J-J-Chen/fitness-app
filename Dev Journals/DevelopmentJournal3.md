We think we are instead going to make a downloadable program rather than a mobile app. The reason for this is that mobile apps take far too long to program, and we don't have time to build one. Instead, we plan to use java to code the fitness app for a computer program. The user will simply have to download the program. It will have the same features as the fitness app such as data storage and recommendations, but this time it will be on a computer. We tried learning Android Studio, but we would have to spend a month learning the application which would take too long. Our program will be a lot like a blend between project 18 and project 14 in that it will prompt the user with data questions and enable for data storage. At the end, the user may request for a script of his health profile which will be printed by HTML.
