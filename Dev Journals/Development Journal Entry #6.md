Jai and I are making a plan for work over Spring break. We are in the midst of setting goals and priorities for our fitness app. We have some pages set up for the app, but we need to add some functionality to it such as a data storage component. We plan on doing this function first as it is the easiest to do. Hopefully, all will go well, and we can add more functionality such as a data suggester. We are not sure how far into this project we will get within the time frame, but hopefully we can at least add the data suggester and storage components of the app. The GUI is coming along well, but we need to route buttons to different menus within the app. Not a lot of work was completed within the app this week as I was in Las Vegas over the weekend, but hopefully we can complete a lot over Spring Break.
