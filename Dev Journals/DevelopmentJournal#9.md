This week was a good week (shocker I know right) that we planned our plan until our next deliverable. We actually were productive in class this time and planned out what we have to do for the app together as a team. So far I have been doing a lot of the hard work, creating layouts and the code for the app but that will change soon enough here. I assigned Joe to learn how layouts work in Android (good luck Joe) and create the main layout for the way the workouts will be shown after you click on a muslce group on the layout that shows a picture of the human body. So that is up to Joe, for me I have to continue to implemnt the app. I did request an API request from My Fitness Pal (MFP) so that I can use their API for another feature in our app to search food or workouts that give information about that specific food or workout. I have to learn how HTTP requests work and connect to their server. I will continue follow the tutorial to implement the "notes" part in the app. SO that is what happened this week. It is going to be better as we will get more time to work on the app in class as we are almost done with all the projects. So hopefully we need to kick it in high gear now for our app and finish it!
