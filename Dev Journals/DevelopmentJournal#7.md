Well crap cakes. I know Schreiber you can call us screwed, but I legit think that we still will you know have time to finish at least the GUI of the app. It is due in 5 days and that is plenty for me to work endless upon endless nights to finish it with Joe. Joe and I talked about splitting whatever responsiblities we needed to to finish the app. To be fair 5 days out of my spring break were gone because of many other highly productive things like I created my own buisness (not even kidding) and other volunteer work like Boise Code Camp! So those things were there but no excuses I need to get the work done and that is what I will do so yea this development journal address that we really did almost nothing on the project except plan for how everything is going to look like.
