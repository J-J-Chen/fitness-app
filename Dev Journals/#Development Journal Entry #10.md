#Development Journal Entry #10
##April 15, 2016
I have started work on the human body GUI to allow for information on workouts for different body parts. I have removed the labels from the body image and now have to make the body parts clickable. This will require many YouTube videos, looking through the other code in the app, and consulting Jai. Jai has been at work in implementing the notes feature into our app. I can see us being able to complete everything in time. Not a lot of work was done over the last week from studying for AP tests and other work, but I expect more work will be done after this weekend. Hopefully, by the end of our project, we'll see an app that has a notes feature, a working GUI, and a body selection page that will depict the human body and allow for the app to detail workouts for certain muscle groups.
