# Proposal: Health and Fitness App 
## App that helps your stay fit and be more healthy 
Jai Bansal and Joseph Gibson 

## Needs and Opportunities
There are a lot of fitness apps, yet some fail to accomplish many things that deal with fitness. Our app will appeal to consumers who play a lot of sports at any level, it will designed
very thoroughly giving a great user interface for the sport motivated, daily routinely lifting or cardio workouts. All around our appeal will be to make an app that is very easy to use, pleasant to look at and highly functional services for daily users. In addition to a fantastic GUI, we also expect to have a "Exercise Suggestion" function within the app. In regards to the diet department of health, we also plan to have a function that enables the user to find the nutritional facts for the foods they eat. 

## Audience / Clients / Users
The main audience this appeals to this is for the fitness motivated. It can be also used for the everyday person, but the person who lifts consistently or goes out and plays sports
will benefit more from using this app. In testing this, we will give it to multiple friends I have that play certain sports that we will be implementing along with the everday 
person who really isn't into sports for great testing data. 

## Product
The actual product is going to be an app you can download from the Google Play Store (maybe Apple Store we we'll see), that you can spend a minute on setting up and then 
use it without any frustrations

## Timeline
Our timeline is going to be the first deliverable to be outlining the user interface. By outlining the user interface, we will know what things need to be implemented and how. 
By the second deliverable, we will actually have implemented all of the interfaces required for the fitness app, accelerometer connectivity, and how that all relates. By the third
deliverable, we will be adding more as we go along, fixing any bugs along the way and polishing up our final product to present by May 27th. 

| Date          | Deliverable   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26   | Finished UI and finalized implementation|
| April 1       | Implementations into the UI|
| April 29      | Adding remaining Implementations and fixing any bugs|

## Reality Check
The equipment we need is going to be simple. We both will just use GitHub to collaborate on our coding, and we will use Android Studio to code our app interface. We don't 
need any fancy hardware as this is going to be a software app that anyone can download on their app. I will also be getting help with some of the app
developers at my Dad's company but that is free of charge. 

## Conclusion
I really love design. I think it always goes back to Steve Jobs, anything designed well and actually WORKS, is something that will always be popular. Sure there 
are a lot of fitness apps, but we are shooting for something unique aimed towards athletes like Joe and I. So designing this app in about 4 months with just
two people, yes will be hard, but in the end we are going to learn a lot. We will be proud enough to make something that people will like and also mostly
I love seeing someone download an app they can rely on and bring a smile to their face. That is our main purpose in designing this app.
